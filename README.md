# Hybrid Isolation Forest + Autoencoder for Anomaly Detection

In high-dimensional systems, traditional anomaly detection models often fail to generalize across noise, corruption, or synthetic data distributions. This repository presents a **hybrid approach** combining:

* **Isolation Forests** for fast, tree-based anomaly scoring
* **Autoencoders** for deep reconstruction-based anomaly detection

Together, they provide a robust and interpretable pipeline for **synthetic anomaly detection in time-series cost data**.

## 🧠 Method Overview

1. **Synthetic cost data generation**
2. **Min-Max scaling + train/test split**
3. **Isolation Forest scoring**
4. **Autoencoder training (MSE loss + Adam optimizer)**
5. **Quantile-based thresholding (95%)**
6. **Evaluation (ROC-AUC + classification report)**

The reconstruction errors from the autoencoder and the decision function of the Isolation Forest are used to classify normal vs. anomalous behavior.

## 📦 Prerequisites

Make sure the following libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn torch
```

Recommended: Run in a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repository and run the following code
```bash
https://github.com/abhimanyu86/-anomaly-detection-with-isolation-forest-and-autoencoder.git
cd anomaly-detection-with-isolation-forest-and-autoencoder/
python main.py
```

## 🧬 Architecture: Autoencoder

A simple fully connected autoencoder is used for unsupervised feature learning:

```
Input → FC (ReLU) → Bottleneck → FC (ReLU) → Output
```

Training minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) between inputs and outputs.
